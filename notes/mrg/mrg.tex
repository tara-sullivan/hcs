Why has gender convergence been different across fields?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Differences in preferences or abilities

    \item Misallocation of talent; may impact aggregate productivity growth

    % \item College major choice matters for future income \ccdoi{10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110908}{(Altonji, Blom, and Meghir 2012)}
\end{itemize}

% \vspace{2ex}
% Common explanations for why convergence might not occur:
% \begin{itemize}

\textbf{This paper:} attempts to answer this question using a model of human capital specialization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Agents with unknown heterogeneous abilities
    \item Fields of study with heterogeneous wages
    \item Use courses to learn about underlying abilities
\end{itemize}

2. Gender gaps in college choice
\begin{itemize}
    \item Empirically motivated by Sloan, Hurst, and Black (2019)  % pre-labor market human capital specialization
%     % Use newly expanded ACS data that asks about major choice for college educated individuals

Identification:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $w$: Average expected lifetime wages by gender and field (ACS data)
    % \item $\theta:$ Underlying probability of success: I will make an assumption to make this simplify, but not sure if I want to:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Assume equal
    %     \item Assume matches aggregate beliefs (this is what I'm leaning towards)
    %     \item Assume matches group beliefs
    % \end{itemize} 
    \item $\nu$: Mincerian returns to education (ACS data) 
\end{itemize}
Initial beliefs:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item NCES Transcript study to estimate $\mu$
    \item IPEDS data for $\alpha_{j0}$
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2ex}
Note: assuming genders have the same ability and same success rates reduces the parameters I need to estimate

Important to consider how discrimination can impact model through:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wages
    \item Probability of success
\end{itemize}
In general, worth considering how this model connects to statistical discrimination

% Assuming $h_{j0} = \nu_j \alpha_{j0}$ and letting $c_{jt}$ be the number of periods and individual spends studying $j$, the stopping condition in this problem simplifies to:
% \begin{equation*}
%     \frac{1- \delta}{\delta} \geq \frac{1}{c_{jt} + \alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0}} \implies 
%     c_j^* = \left\lceil \frac{\delta}{1 - \delta} \right\rceil - (\alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0})
% \end{equation*}
% This yields the index function:
% \begin{align*}
% \mathcal{I}_{jt} (h_{jt}, \alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt}) = 
% \begin{cases}
% \frac{w_{jt} h_{jt}}{1 - \delta} & \text{if } \{\alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt}\} \in \mathcal{G}_{j}, \\

%    } & \text{if } \{\alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt}\} \notin \mathcal{G}_{j} \\

% \end{align*}
% And graduation region:
% \begin{equation*}
%    \mathcal{G}_j =  \left\{ \alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt} \left\vert c_{jt} \geq \left\lceil \frac{\delta}{1 - \delta} \right\rceil - (\alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0}) \right. \right\}

% Monotonicity of stopping problem (ensured by $h_{j0} \leq \nu \alpha_{j0}$) 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item [$\implies$] Optimality of one-step-look-ahead, i.e. comparing

Assuming $h_{j0} = \nu \alpha_{j0}$ and letting $c_{jt}$ be time spent studying $j$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [$\implies$] Deterministic stopping function
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{1- \delta}{\delta} \geq \frac{1}{c_{jt} + \alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0}} \implies

Graduation regions given by:
\begin{equation*}
