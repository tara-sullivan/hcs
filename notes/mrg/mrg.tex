\begin{frame}{Optimal policy theorem}

Define the skill $j$ index as the expected payoff if you committed to studying $j$:
%\gen{ 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{I}_j (h_j, P_j) = \sup_{\tau \geq 0} \mathbb{E}^\tau
\ce{
   \sum_{t=0}^\infty \delta^t \pr{\ell_{jt} w_j h_{jt}}}
   {(h_{j0}, P_{j0}) = (h_j, P_j)
}
% \mathcal{I}_{jt} (h_{jt}, \alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt}) = 
% \begin{cases}
% \frac{h_{jt}}{1 - \delta} & \text{if } \{\alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt}\} \in \mathcal{G}_{j}, \\
% \frac{h_{jt}}{1 - \delta} \sbr{
%    \frac{
%       \left\lceil \frac{\delta}{1 - \delta} \right\rceil
%       \delta^{\left\lceil \frac{\delta}{1 - \delta} \right\rceil - c_{jt} - \alpha_{j0} - \beta_{j0}}}
%    {c_{jt} + \alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0}}
%    } & \text{if } \{\alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt}\} \notin \mathcal{G}_{j} \\
% \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

Define the graduation region of skill $j$ as: 
\begin{equation*}
% \mathcal{G}_j =  \left\{ \alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt} \left\vert c_{jt} \geq \left\lceil \frac{\delta}{1 - \delta} \right\rceil - (\alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0}) \right. \right\}
\mathcal{G}_j = \left\{ (h_j, P_j) \left\vert
   \arg \max_{\tau \geq 0} 
   \mathbb{E}^\tau \ce{\sum_{t=0}^\infty \delta^t \pr{\ell_{jt} w_j h_{jt}}}
   {(h_j, P_j)} = 0
   \right. \right\}
\end{equation*}

The following policy $\pi: (h_t, P_t) \to (s_t, \ell_t)$ is optimal: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item At each $t \geq 0$, choose skill $j^* = \arg \max_{i \in N} \mathcal{I}_i$, breaking ties according to any rule
	\item If $(h_{j^*}, P_{j^*}) \in \mathcal{G}_{j}$, then enter the labor market as a $j^*$ specialist. Otherwise, study $j^*$ for an additional period.  
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

Even better parameterization:
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{I}_j (h_j, P_j) = \sup_{\tau \geq 0} \mathbb{E}^\tau
\ce{
   \sum_{t=0}^\infty \delta^t \pr{\ell_{jt} w_j h_{jt}}}
   {(h_{j0}, P_{j0}) = (h_j, P_j)
}
\end{equation*}
Stopping problem monotone if: 
\begin{equation*}
    \nu \alpha_{j0} \geq h_{j0}
\end{equation*}
This implies optimality of the OSLA condition; optimal policy implies:
