\begin{outline}

\item Current literature on discrimination/affirmative action in higher education: \nts{(goal is to find a statement that encapsulates the following in a relevant way)}

\begin{blist}

\item Whether or not it helps or hurts the minority students it's meant to help \parencite{AL16}

\item Whether or not employing these policies is biased against students in the majority category\footnote{
   Maybe cite something about the Harvard trial here; we read a nice piece in ECON128 in Week 8. 
}

\item Specifically consider choice of college major and the focus on student preparedness \textcite{AAH16} 

\end{blist}

\item Shortcomings of the literature I want to address: \nts{(still working through this)}

\begin{blist}

%\item %Empirical studies rely on very precise mechanisms; I want something flexble.

\item \nts{I think the focus on student preparedness and outcomes misses a couple of things. First, measuring preparedness by GPA and SAT score, as is often the case, misses a lot. I don't know if I can address this, but I think it's important to mention. Second, misallocation of human capital has aggregate welfare effects. Empirical results can't account for that. This is something I can get at. }

\nts{\item I also don't like assuming that the college process is the same for different groups. The cost function for particular majors may be very different for one group; note that this is where the \textcite{CL93} framework might be useful.}

\end{blist}

\item This paper:

\begin{blist}

\item I consider the relationship between discrimination theories \nts{and existing group outcomes} and human capital specialization
% How do different theories of discrimination impact human capital specialization? 

\item Augment model of gradual human capital specialization in \textcite{AF20}

\item Flexible framework that accommodates mechanisms that are not generally accounted for in this literature. \

\item Existing grout outcomes have an impact on human capital specialization decisions. 

\item Shocks received impact human capital specialization decisions. Key: shocks impact groups differently \nts{(I think)}.

\item Incorporates statistical discrimination 

\item limitations of empirical analyses when evaluating the efficacy of affirmative action programs. 

\item Counterfactual analysis: misallocation of human capital specialization

\item Counterfactual analysis: the effectiveness of affirmative action policies. 

\end{blist}

% Another application: how do peopl specialize after recessions

% prior determined by existing outcomes
% prior determined by statistical discrimination 
% how you interpret shocks 


% One nice thing about this being a partial equilibrium approach: human capital here is really just whether your investment in a class pays off in a higher wage in the future. There could still be frictions between your underlying ability and your wage.

% Notes/questions
\nts{
\begin{itemize}
\item Shouldn't I either index $\pi$ by $t$, or say that a policy at time $t$ is optimal? 
\item Shouldn't this be if $s_{it} = 1$, meaning that you study $i$ during period $t$, rather than ``if $i$ is selected?''. I'm pretty sure that, because you could choose to work in skill $i$, you need to specify if you're studying.
\item Also, shouldn't the transition laws be $h_{it+1} = H_i (h_{it}, a_{it}, s_{it})$, since it depends on whether you study? This could also be fixed by changing the ``if $i$ selected line.'' I would also call this transition law ``course outcome'' or ``studying outcome.''
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Optimal Policy}

Let $\tau$ be an optimal stopping rule defined over $\{ a_{j1}, a_{j2}, \dots \}$. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Skill j index
Define the skill $j$ index as the expected payoff if you committed to studying $j$:
%\gen{ 
\begin{equation}\label{idx}
\mathcal{I}_j (h_j, P_j) = \sup_{\tau \geq 0} \mathbb{E}^\tau
\ce{
   \sum_{t=0}^\infty \delta^t U_j (w_j, h_{jt}) \ell_{jt}}
   {(h_{j0}, P_{j0}) = (h_j, P_j))

\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Graduation region
Define the graduation region of skill $j$ as: 
\begin{equation}\label{grad}
\mathcal{G}_j = \left\{ (h_j, P_j) \left\vert
   \arg \max_{\tau \geq 0} 
   \mathbb{E}^\tau \ce{\sum_{t=0}^\infty \delta^t U_j (w_j, h_j) \ell_{jt}}
   {(h_j, P_j)} = 0
   \right. \right\}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Optimal policy theorem
The following policy $\pi: (h_t, P_t) \to (s_t, \ell_t)$ is optimal: 
\begin{outline}
	\item At each $t \geq 0$, choose skill $j^* = \arg \max_{i \in N} \mathcal{I}_i$, breaking ties according to any rule
	\item If $(h_{j^*}, P_{j^*}) \in \mathcal{G}_{j}$, then enter the labor market as a $j^*$ specialist. Otherwise, study $j^*$ for an additional period.  
\end{outline}
Assuming $h_{j0} \leq \nu \alpha_{j0}$ means that the stopping problem is monotonic.\nts{\footnote{I need better inutition about what this assumption means.}}
The monotonicity of the stopping problem implies that one-step look-ahead is optimal.\nts{\footnote{
	Should this statement go before or after the statement of the optimal policy? 
	Is this statement fully correct? 
}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Parameterizations}

It is helpful to consider several typues of parameterizations of this problem. 

\begin{outline}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Most tractable case

\hitem{Assume $h_{j0} = \nu \alpha_{j0}$}

Letting $c_{jt}$ be the number of periods and individual spends studying $j$, the stopping condition in this problem simplifies to:
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{1- \delta}{\delta} \geq \frac{1}{c_{jt} + \alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0}}
\end{equation*}
This implies that the number of periods the individual spends studying skill $j$ before entering the labor market is deterministic: 
\begin{equation}\label{bb-mj}
	c_j^* = \left\lceil \frac{\delta}{1 - \delta} \right\rceil - (\alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0})
\end{equation}
Under this assumption, the optimal policy can written analytically:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{I}_{jt} (h_{jt}, \alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt}) = &
\begin{cases}
\frac{h_{jt}}{1 - \delta} & \text{if } \{\alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt}\} \in \mathcal{G}_{j}, \\
\frac{h_{jt}}{1 - \delta} \sbr{
   \frac{
      \left\lceil \frac{\delta}{1 - \delta} \right\rceil
      \delta^{\left\lceil \frac{\delta}{1 - \delta} \right\rceil - c_{jt} - \alpha_{j0} - \beta_{j0}}}
   {c_{jt} - \alpha_{j0} - \beta_{j0}}
   } & \text{if } \{\alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt}\} \notin \mathcal{G}_{j} \\
\end{cases} \\
   \mathcal{G}_j = & \left\{ \alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt} \left\vert c_{jt} \geq \left\lceil \frac{\delta}{1 - \delta} \right\rceil - (\alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0}) \right. \right\}
\end{align*}
% Notes/questions
\nts{
\begin{blist}
   \item Shouldn't it be $\mathcal{G}_{j^*}$?
   \item Shouldn't $\tau$ be indexed by $j$?
   \item Is graduation region based on OSLA or initial conditions? I think that when I have some of my ECON200B notes around, I should think about how I could more cleanly write the optimal stopping rule. May it would be clearer to write $\tau_j$?
\end{blist}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% More reasonable case

\hitem{Assume $h_{j0} \leq \nu \alpha_{j0}$}

The stopping condition in this problem simplifies to:
\begin{equation}\label{stop}
	\frac{1- \delta}{\delta} \geq 
	\frac{\nu \alpha_{j0} + h_{jt} - h_{j0}}{h_{jt}(c_{jt} + \alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0})}
\end{equation}
The index and graduation region are modified accordingly.

\subsubsection*{Math notes}

Math theorem: If stopping time problem monotonic, then OSLA (one-step look-ahead) stopping rule optimal. 
\begin{blist}

\item Monotonic stopping time: If the optimal stopping rule for skill $j$ says stop today, then the optimal stopping rule would say stop tomorrow, regardless of the stochastic outcome. This would be built into the human capital problem. 

\item Monotonicity of the stopping problem means that stopping at $t$ implies stopping at $t+1$. Stopping at time $t$ implies: \nts{(I think)}
\begin{equation*}
 U_j(w_j, h_{jt}) > \delta \mathbb{E} U_j(w_j, h_{jt+1})
\end{equation*}
If the stoping problem is monotonic, then this means: 
\begin{equation*}
 U_j(w_j, h_{jt+1}) > \delta \mathbb{E} U_j(w_j, h_{jt+2})
\end{equation*}
This holds for all realizations of $a$. 
This condition then implies the optimality of OSLA.

Given the utility function in the parametric problem, if you are studying skill $j$, you would stop at time $t$ if:
\begin{equation}
h_{jt} > \delta \mathbb{E} \sbr{h_{jt+1}}
\end{equation}
The optimal stopping time is monotonic if the following holds for all $j$, for all realizations of $a_{jt}$:
\begin{equation}
h_{jt+1} > \delta \mathbb{E} \sbr{h_{jt+2}}
\end{equation}
Recall:
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E} \sbr{h_{jt+1}} = \delta (h_{jt} + \mathbb{E} \sbr{a_{it}} s_{it})
\end{align*}
You stop studying skill $j$ at time $t$ ($s_{jt}=0$) if the utility associated with stopping is greater than the expected utility associated with studying ($s_{jt}=1$):
\begin{align*}
h_{jt} >& \delta \mathbb{E} \sbr{h_{jt+1}} \\
=& \delta (h_{jt} + \mathbb{E} \sbr{a_{jt}} s_{jt}) \\
=& \delta h_{jt} + \delta \pr{\nu_j \mathbb{E} \sbr{\theta_j} + 0 (1 - \mathbb{E} \sbr{\theta_j})} \\
=& \delta h_{jt} + \delta \pr{\nu_j \frac{\alpha_{jt}}{\alpha_{jt} + \beta_{jt}}} \\
\implies h_{jt} >& \frac{\delta}{1 - \delta} \pr{\frac{\nu_j \alpha_{jt}}{\alpha_{jt} + \beta_{jt}}}
\end{align*}
Using the fact that $h_{jt} = h_{j0} + \nu (\alpha_{jt} - \alpha_0)$ and the assumption that $h_{j0} = \alpha_{j0} h_{j0}$, the above implies:
\begin{equation*}
\nu \alpha_{jt} > \frac{\delta}{1 - \delta} \pr{\frac{\nu_j \alpha_{jt}}{\alpha_{jt} + \beta_{jt}}} \iff \frac{1-\delta}{\delta} > \alpha_{jt} + \beta_{jt}
\end{equation*} 
\nts{I'm not finishing this right now. But it's worth noting that, in the notes that Titan gave me, a sufficient condition for monotonicity in the beta-Bernoulli problem is that $h_{j0} = \alpha_{j0} h_{j0}$. So I know that you can prove that, under this assumption, the problem is monotonic. I might need to relax that assumption for my model, but it doesn't need to be a problem.}

\subsection{Augmented model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Preliminaries}

\begin{blist}



\item I now consider how a student's human capital specialization decisions are affected by their group.
This involves augmenting the above model so that each student has a group type, $g$.
To keep things simple, assume there are only two groups, men and women ($g \in \{m, f\}$).\nts{\footnote{\nts{Possible extension: countably infinite types. What does this mean if you value diversity? Could you get results like diversity helps students who are not in the targeted group to assist?}}} 
The distributions of underlying abilities, $\theta_j$, are the same for men and women.\nts{\footnote{\nts{
  What is the maintained hypothesis in a Bayesian problem?
  Am I assuming that $\theta_j$ is distributed 
}}}
However, initial beliefs about underlying abilities, $P_{j0}^g \equiv \mathcal{B} \pr{\alpha_{j0}^g, \beta_{j0}^g}$, are different for the two groups.
\nts{Be specific about what this will do.}

\item 
\nts{The following would maybe be in the initial model description:}
The ability parameter $\theta_j$ is the probability that a student successfully improves their human capital in subject $j$ after studying it for one period.
A student's decision to enter a particular field depends in part on how much human capital they can expect to successfully acquire, and therefore depends on $\theta_j$.
It may be helpful to think of $\theta_j$ as the student's probability of success or failure in a particular course in field $j$.\footnote{
   It is worth highlighting that the following assumes that probability of success or failure is independent and stationary throughout time.}
The distribution of beliefs about $\theta_j$ %, $\mathcal{B} \pr{\alpha_{j0}^g, \beta_{j0}^g}$, 
is a distribution of beliefs about probabilities.\nts{\footnote{\nts{For a nice, intuitive understanding of this, see \url{https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/47782}}}}
How these beliefs are formed is central to this paper.

\item 
%A student may use previously observed success rates to their prior about their probability of success may use 
A student may form their belief about their probability of success using existing outcomes for their group.
For this example, suppose a type $g$ student's belief about their own $\theta_j^g$ is based on previously observed success rates for group $g$. 
Let $\alpha_{j0}^g$ and $\beta_{j0}^g$ denote the number of type $g$ students who have succeeded and failed in field $j$ at time 0, respectively.\footnote{
   I am being purposefully vague about what ``studying'' and ``succeeding'' represent.
   For example, the number of ``successful'' students could be:
   \begin{footcount}
      \item The number of students who graduated into field $j$
      \item The number of students who attain human capital $h_j$
      \item Both (a) and (b)
      \item The number of students who pass an initial course in field $j$
    \end{footcount} 
   Many other examples are possible. The total number of observed students who attempt success would need to account for those who tried going this route and failed. 
  \nts{
  This is tricky, and very important. 
  How this endogenously responds is super key; I may run into complications here regarding how this belief updates. I'm assuming that you form your belief when you enter the field, and then that doesn't change at all. It doesn't allow for leaky pipelines to impact beliefs, but this could probably be changed.}
}  
Then the observed success rate, $\mu_{j}^g$, is given by:
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{j0}^g = 
  \frac{\alpha_{j0}^m}{\alpha_{j0}^g + \beta_{j0}^g}.
  %\mu_{j0} = 
  %\frac{\alpha_{j0}^m}{\alpha_{j0}^m + \beta_{j0}^m} = 
  %\frac{\alpha_{j0}^f}{\alpha_{j0}^f + \beta_{j0}^f}
\end{equation*}
This average is based on a sample of type $g$ students of size $n_{j0}^g = \alpha_{j0}^g + \beta_{j0}^g$.
Note that the prior distribution $\mathcal{B} \pr{\alpha_{j0}^g, \beta_{j0}^g}$ can now be specified using an alternative parameterization, $\mathcal{B} \pr{\mu_{j0}^g n_{j0}^g, (1 - \mu_{j0}^g) n_{j0}^g}$.

\item
Assume the sample size of men is larger than that of women, but the observed success rate is the same for the two groups:
\begin{equation*}
  n_{j0}^m > n_{j0}^f, \quad \quad \mu_{j0} = \mu_{j0}^m = \mu_{j0}^w.
  %n_{j0}^m = \alpha_{j0}^m + \beta_{j0}^m > \alpha_{j0}^f + \beta_{j0}^f = n_{j0}^w
\end{equation*}
%Assuming the prior on $\theta_j$ follows a $\mathcal{B} \pr{\alpha_{j0}^g, \beta_{j0}^g}$ distribution, this yields the following parameterization:
This implies that women have more uncertainty regarding their underlying abilities than men.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Results}

\begin{outline}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Most tractable case

\hitem{Assume $h_{j0} = \nu \alpha_{j0}$}

This is a strong assumption, and one that I'm not particularly fond of; it implies that $h_{j0}^w < h_{j0}^m$, meaning initial human capital starts out lower for women. 
However, it provides a simplification that highlights useful features of the model.\nts{\footnote{\nts{
  This might not be that bad. Human capital $h$ is how much the market values your success in courses. 
  If the market values women less, they might have more to prove. 
  That view ignores the genuine returns to education, so it would be tricky to make that argument.
}}} 

\begin{blist}

\item First note that, according to \eqref{bb-mj}, $c_j^{m*} \leq c_j^{w*}$. 
Intuitively, women who become $j$-specialists study more than men. 
This is somewhat mechanical, because this assumption implies that women begin with lower levels of human capital.
This is because women have more uncertainty regarding their underlying ability. 

This is because women have more uncertainty about their underlying ability, and therefore need more information.
This is a somewhat mechanical result, since women are assumed to begin at lower levels of human capital than men in this scenario. 
The important intuition is that women have more uncertainty than men with respect to their abilities.
They therefore need to spend more time studying to build up certainty before entering the labor market in this field.

% This is probably a no, but could this be helpful for understanding convergence in education outcomes? 

% What's interesting for this case is the dynamics in the economy as a whole for this case. 

% Do we often see overeducated women? \nts{Could this feed into maternity outcomes? }

\item The graduation region in \eqref{grad} can now be written as:
\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{G}_j = \left\{ \alpha_{jt}, \beta_{jt} \left\vert c_{jt} \geq c_j^* \right. \right\}.
\end{equation*}
Because $c_j^{m*} \leq c_j^{w*}$, there are values of $(h_{jt}, c_{jt})$ such that men will not continue on, but women will. 

\item Finally, I believe that, given $(h_{jt}, c_{jt})$, the continuation payoff of staying in $j$ is larger for men than for women. \nts{I do want to check my math on this. }

\end{blist}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% More reasonable case

\hitem{Assume $h_{j0} \leq \nu \alpha_{j0}$}

The stopping condition \eqref{stop} can be written using the alternative parameterization: 
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{1- \delta}{\delta} \geq 
	\frac{\nu n_{j0} \mu_{j0} + h_{jt} - h_{j0}}{h_{jt}(c_{jt} + n_{j0})}
\end{equation*}
The left-hand side of this equation is decreasing in $n$ if $c_{jt} \mu_{j0} < \frac{h_{jt} - h_{j0}}{\nu}$. 
Thus, a small sample size leads to a broader graduation region if $c_{jt} \mu_{j0} < \frac{h_{jt} - h_{j0}}{\nu}$.
Intuitively, this condition means that the amount of time you expected to succeed in this many courses is less than the amount of time you actually succeeded. 
This means that there exist men and women with the same $(h_{jt}, c_{jt})$ for whom the smaller sample size $n_{j0}^w$ will cause women to leave the field, whereas men will continue on. 
%Intuitively, this means that your expected success rate conditional only on means is less than your observed success rate. Intuitively, marginal women who have been unlucky will exit, whereas men will continue on. 

% Next: consider what this means for continuation values, if anything
% Then: what does it mean in the context of affirmative action papers (maybe start with this first)

\end{outline}


% Next: what does this imply if you fail and you're a woman? What about if you fail and you're a man? 

% Show that after failure, women might quit whereas men continue on
