# Overview of `img/` directory

    * code/
    * `*.tex` (PGF plots code)

The primary output for this project are PDFs generated in TeX, specifically my slides (`writeups/slides/slides.pdf`) and my paper (`writeups/paper/outline.pdf`). 
To generate these PDFs, I compile  `writeups/slides/slides.tex` and `writeups/paper/outline.tex`, respectively (henceforth referred to as `slides.tex` and `outline.tex`). 
These PDFs contain figures generated using programs from my `model/` and `data/` directories.
I generate these figures in Python using matplotlib, but need to save them in a TeX-friendly way.
To do this, I convert my matplotlib lib code to TeX code using  [tikzplotlib](https://github.com/nschloe/tikzplotlib). 
That way, I can natively compile my figures in TeX using [PGF plots](http://pgfplots.sourceforge.net/)

The many `.tex` files in this folder contain TeX code for particular images that have been generated using matplotlib and converted to TeX code using [tikzplotlib](https://github.com/nschloe/tikzplotlib). 
These files are then imported into `outline.tex` or `slides.tex` to generate PDFs of figures. 
The `/img/code/` sub-directory contains programs I commonly import when generating figures in the `/model/` or `/data/` directories. 

## `code/` sub-directory

The `/img/code/` sub-directory contains programs I commonly import when generating figures in the `/model/` or `/data/` directories. 
I currently set some common parameters using these programs; I could perhaps do this in amore systematic way, instead of re-importing the same modules, but explicitly importing hasn't been a hassle so far. 

## PGF plots code

The .tex files in this directory have been generated by other programs in the `/model/` or `/data/` directories.
After generating the images in Python using matplotlib, I use the [tikzplotlib](https://github.com/nschloe/tikzplotlib) package to save tikz code that will create an identical figure in TeX.

To determine exactly which program created each .tex file, I generally just search GitHub. 

### Generating the .tex code using tikzplotlib

### Generate standalone PDFs of these files

To actually see standalone PDFs of these images, you can either:
	1. Generate standalone versions of these images. This can be done using the `img/code/standalone.tex` file.
	2. Compile the full TeX document (`slides.tex` or `outline.tex`) and externalize the PGF plots.
Details on both of these methods are below. \

I generate standalone PDFs of these files when compiling my TeX code. 
To generate standalone versions of figures (and to make my TeX code compile faster), externalize the PGFPlots figures.
