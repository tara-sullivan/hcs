# Overview of `data/` directory

    * ipeds/
        * c/
        * gr/
    * acs/
   
This directory contains IPEDS data used in this project. 
Two IPEDS surveys are used: completion surveys and graduation surveys.
Replication instructions for the completion surveys can be found in the `data/ipeds/c/`; see the readme in that folder for more information.
Replication instructions for graduation surveys can be found in `data/ipeds/gr/`; see the readme in that folder for more information.
    
The IPEDS graduation survey directory (in `ipeds/gr/`) and ACS data directory (in `acs/`) only have some exploratory/basic cleaning programs.
I may not use these data in the final version of this project.
For a detailed example of how I structure data tasks, see the IPEDS completion surveys, located in `ipeds/c/`)
