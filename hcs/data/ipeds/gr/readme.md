# IPEDS Graduation Surveys

## About the data

Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data are collected annually by the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) and describe the universe of institutions that participate in federal student financial aid programs. 
IPEDS Graduation Surveys describe the number of full-time, first-degree students complete their degrees at postsecondary institutions.
This includes the number of students completing their program within 150% the normal period of time, transfer, or are no longer enrolled, by gender and race/ethnicity;
and the number of students who completed their program within 200% of normal time. 
For more details on the IPEDS series, please visit https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/.

## Using this directory

The file `ipeds_gr_clean.py` performs basic checks and aggregations of the data, to check for understanding. It also creates a useable dataframe of IPEDS graduation data. 
I'm unsure if I will use these data in my final project; ideally I need graduation rates by institution by field of study. 
But I'll keep this here for future documentation.
