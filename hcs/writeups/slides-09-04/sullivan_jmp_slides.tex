\begin{frame}{Gender convergence across fields}

Do differences in gender convergence across fields represent misallocation of talent?
\begin{itemize}
    \item If yes, this has macroeconomic consequences 
    

    % \item College major choice matters for future income \ccdoi{10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110908}{(Altonji, Blom, and Meghir 2012)}
\end{itemize}

% \vspace{2ex}
% Common explanations for why convergence might not occur:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Preferences
%     \item Abilities
%     \item Discrimination in labor market
%     \item <2-> Beliefs

\textbf{This paper:} the role of group-based beliefs in human capital specialization decisions

\vspace{3ex}
Model of gradual human capital specialization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unknown heterogeneous abilities 
    \item Group-based beliefs about abilities 
    \item Sequential learning and human capital accumulation
    \item [$\implies$] Group-based beliefs play an important role in specialization decisions
\end{itemize}
% present a model of human capital and learning ability
% beliefs result in different course taking characterisitcs

\vspace{3ex}
What are the productivity costs associated with misallocation of talent implied by the model? 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Estimate impact of misallocation on aggregate productivity growth in line with \ccdoi{10.3982/ECTA11427}{Hsieh, Hurst, Jones, and Klenow (2019)} 
\end{itemize}

1. Human capital specialization
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build on model of gradual specialization from Alon and Fershtman (2019)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{4ex}
2. Gender gaps in college choice
\begin{itemize}
    \item Empirically motivated by Sloan, Hurst, and Black (2020)  % pre-labor market human capital specialization
%     % Use newly expanded ACS data that asks about major choice for college educated individuals
%     % Women choose college majors associated with lower potential wages than men
%     % Need to understand this better!!
% Gender gap in schooling and experience has shrunk
\end{itemize}

\vspace{4ex}
3. Determinants of college major choice, in particular the role of beliefs
\begin{itemize}
    \item Arcidiacono et al. (2015): model of sequential learning and role of beliefs
    % does not easily allow for granual fields
    % no human capital accumulation
    \item Subjective expectations literature (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2014; Wiswall and Zafar, 2019; Zafar, 2013)
\end{itemize}

4. Statistical discrimination literature 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lundberg and Startz (1984): efficiency of equal opportunity laws
    \item Coate and Loury (1997): permanent affirmative action and patronizing equilibria

\begin{frame}{Identification problem}\label{identification}

Identification problem: how to identify $(\alpha_{j0}^g, \beta_{j0}^g)$?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parameters that characterize prior beliefs about probability of success ($\theta_j$)
\end{itemize}

% \vspace{2ex} 
% Transcript data available via BPS surveys or NLSY97
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item 
% \end{itemize}

\vspace{2ex}
The following state variables are observable using transcript data (BPS or NLSY97):
\begin{align*}
    \overline{m}_{jt} &= \sum_{r=0}^{t-1} m_{jr}, \quad \quad \overline{s}_{jt} = \sum_{r=0}^{t-1} s_{jr}
\end{align*}
Goal: find likelihood function to estimate ($\alpha_{j0}^g, \beta_{j0}^g$).
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine the best way to incorporate population heterogeneity (random utility? Semi-nonparametric approaches?)
    \item Balance endogeneity concerns with taking advantage of the recursive structure
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2ex}
Possible example: conditional logit approach:
\begin{equation*}
    \log \mathcal{L} = \log \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j=1}^J m_{ijt} \log P(m_{ijt} = 1 \vert \overline{m}_{ijt}, \overline{s}_{ijt}, \alpha_{j0}, \beta_{j0}, \theta_{ji})

\begin{frame}{Useful model notes}\label{id_model_notes}

Under the parametric assumption, agents study a field for a deterministic number of periods: \ \hyperlink{sim_parameterization}{\beamerbutton{Details}}
\begin{equation*}
    m_{j}^* = \left\lceil{\frac{\delta}{1 - \delta}}\right\rceil - \alpha_{j0} - \beta_{j0}
\end{equation*}
Can analytically characterize Index in field $j$:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{I}_{jt} (\alpha_{j0}, \beta_{j0}, \overline{m}_{jt}, \overline{s}_{jt}) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{w_j h_{jt}}{1 - \delta} &\text{ if } (\alpha_{j0}, \beta_{j0}) \in \mathcal{G}_j \\
    \frac{w_j}{1 - \delta} \delta^{m_j^* - \overline{m}_{jt}} \mathbb{E}_t \sbr{h_{j, t + m_j^* - \overline{m}_{jt}}} &\text{ otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Probability an agent chooses $j$ at time $t$ depends on the index:
\begin{align*}
    G_j (x) = P \pr{\mathcal{I}_{jt} < x \vert \cdot} 
    &= P \pr{\condl{
        \delta^{-(\alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0})} 
        \frac{\alpha_{j0} + \overline{s}_{jt}}{\alpha_{j0} + \beta_{j0} + \overline{m}_{jt}}
        < c_j x
    }
    \overline{m}_{jt}, \overline{s}_{jt}, \alpha_{j0}, \beta_{j0}
    }
\end{align*}
Under conditional independence given all states:
\begin{align*}
    P(m_{jt} = 1 \vert \cdot) &= P(\mathcal{I}_{jt} > \mathcal{I}_{kt} \forall k \neq j \vert \cdot) \\
    &= \int \prod_{k \neq j} G_k (x) d G_j (x)
\end{align*}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion and next steps}

Model suggests that group-based beliefs play an important role in specialization decisions

\vspace{4ex}
Next steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identification of model parameters
    \item Explore counterfactuals: productivity differences if we remove misallocation of talent?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{4ex}
Additional counterfactual exercise: affirmative action 
\begin{itemize}
    \item If we remove discrimination, how long would it take for women's beliefs to converge?
    \item Can affirmative action address these biases?
\end{itemize}

% Are these differential outcomes the result of discrimination? Depends on your definition:
