How can the model explain different specialization outcomes?

Consider a world with two fields, X and Y
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wages are equal: $w_X = w_Y$
    \item The agent's probabilities of success are equal: $\theta_X = \theta_Y$
    \item Initial beliefs are equal to the uninform prior: \hyperlink{model_beta_11}{\beamerbutton{PDF of beliefs}}
    \begin{equation*}
        (\alpha_{X0}, \beta_{X0}) = (\alpha_{Y0}, \beta_{Y0}) = (1, 1)
    \end{equation*}
    \item Assume $h_{j0} = \nu \alpha_{j0}$ \hyperlink{sim_parameterization}{\beamerbutton{Details}}
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3ex}
Simulate agent's specialization decisions when choosing between X and Y
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model fraction of simulated agents choosing X or Y at time $t$ 
\end{itemize}

% risk aspect is on human capital accumulation
% your expected probability of gaining human capital is the same in both of these
% there's risk in timing - risk aversion over time; probably from discounting with linear utility function

%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Start going into y because you have more information
% more quickly will converge into what you go at 

% If you'er going to switch, you know sooner

% In expectation 
% What drives length to degree?
% AFter two periods you have sunk benefit


% Inforamtion value outweight human capital
% risk neutral is human capital 

% spend more in uncertain major 

% benefit 

% why do you spend less time studying when you  have more certainty

% if distribution is tighter, initial 

% any signal makes you more likely to switch if you start in more dispersed prior
% swtiching is bad; want to minimize time you spend in school
% go with option for which you 

% c_j depends on alpha0 and beta0

% poteriro vs posterior predictive

% Y provides more 
% you want to accumulate the most human capital in the shortest amount of time
% want to choose the field to get you to 10 suc
