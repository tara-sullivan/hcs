\begin{abstract}
Although the overall gender gap in postsecondary degree attainment has reversed over the past forty years, significant heterogeneity persists in terms of which fields men and women choose to study.
In this paper, I consider the role of group-based beliefs in explaining these differential convergence rates across fields. 
I assume a student forms their initial belief about their probability of success in a particular field based on past outcomes for their group type. 
I then incorporate group-based beliefs into the model of gradual human capital specialization from \textcite{AF20} to show how these differences in priors can drive human capital specialization decisions amongst otherwise similar agents.
I conclude by discussing how I will use this framework in future research.
