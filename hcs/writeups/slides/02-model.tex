Individuals endowed with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [$h_{j0}$:] Skill-$j$ specific human capital ($j=0,\dots,J$)

Time constraint: At each $t$, individuals can choose to either study ($\study_{jt}$)
or work ($\ell_{jt}$) in one field $j \in \{1, \dots, J\}$:
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{j=0}^J (\study_{jt} + \ell_{jt}) = 1, \quad \quad \study_{jt}, \ell_{jt} \in \{0, 1\}
\end{equation*}

Enter labor market at time $t$ in skill-$j$ to maximize expected lifetime payoff:

    \item Students form beliefs, $P_{j0}$, based on previously observed group successes
\end{itemize}

Simple parameterization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [$\alpha_{j0}^g$: ] Number of type-$g$ students who have succeeded in $j$ 
    \item [$\beta_{j0}^g$: ] Number of type-$g$ students who have failed in $j$

    \mu_{j0}^g = 
      \frac{\alpha_{j0}^g}{\alpha_{j0}^g + \beta_{j0}^g}.

    n_{j0}^g = \alpha_{j0}^g + \beta_{j0}^g

Group-based prior beliefs about probability of success in skill-$j$ courses, $\theta_j$:

A policy $\pi: (h_t, P_t^g) \to (s_t, \ell_t)$ is optimal if it maximizes:

\begin{frame}{Optimal policy rule}

Define the skill $j$ index as the expected payoff if you committed to studying $j$:
%\gen{ 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{I}_{jt} (h_{j}^g, P_{j}^g) = \sup_{\tau \geq 0} \mathbb{E}^\tau
\ce{
   \sum_{t=0}^\infty \delta^t 
   U_j(h_{jt}^g, w_j) \ell_{jt}^g
}{
    (h_{j0}^g, P_{j0}^g) = (h_{j}^g, P_{j}^g)
}
\end{equation*}

Define the graduation region of skill $j$ as: 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{G}_j (h_{j}^g, P_{j}^g)  = 
    \left\{
        (h_{j}^g, P_{j}^g) 
        \left\vert
            \arg \max_{\tau \geq 0} 
            \mathbb{E}^\tau 
            \ce{
                \sum_{t=0}^\infty \delta^t 
                U_j(h_{jt}^g, w_j) \ell_{jt}^g

                (h_j, P_j^g)
            } = 0
   \right. \right\}
\end{equation*}

The following policy $\pi: (h_t, P_t^g) \to (s_t, \ell_t)$ is optimal: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item At each $t \geq 0$, choose skill $j^* = \arg \max_{j \in J} \mathcal{I}_j$, breaking ties according to any rule
    \item If $(h_{j^*}, P_{j^*}^g) \in \mathcal{G}_{j}$, then enter the labor market as a $j^*$ specialist. Otherwise, study $j^*$ for an additional period.
