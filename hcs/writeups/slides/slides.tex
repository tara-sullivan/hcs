\begin{frame}{What drives differences in gender convergence across fields?}

% What drives these differences in gender convergence across field?
% We can look to the literature on the determinants of college major choice for guidance

Why might we see these differences?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Differences in wages
    \item Differences in preferences or norms
    \item Social networks and role models
    \item Uncertainty about abilities
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2ex}
Problem: how do these things interact?
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can your network influence your beliefs about your abilities?
    \item How can shared uncertainty influence norms?

% \textbf{This paper}: builds a model of \blue{human capital specialization} (i.e. major choice)
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Students don't know their true ability in different majors
%     \item Initial beliefs about their abilities are shaped by existing outcome for their group (i.e. gender)
% \end{itemize}
% \textbf{Question:} How does this impact major choice?

\pause
\vspace{2ex}
\textbf{My research:} the role of group-based beliefs in human capital specialization decisions

\vspace{2ex}
Model of gradual human capital specialization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unknown heterogeneous abilities 
    \item Group-based beliefs about abilities 
    \item Sequential learning and human capital accumulation
    \item [$\implies$] Group-based beliefs play an important role in specialization decisions

Definition of statistical discrimination \ccurl{https://www.jstor.org/stable/1808117}{(Lundberg and Startz, 1983)}
\begin{quote}
Economic discrimination exists when groups with equal average initial endowments of productive ability do not receive equal average compensation in equilibrium.
\end{quote}

\vspace{3ex}
Consider if agents begin with
\begin{itemize}
    \item The same levels of initial human capital, $h_{j0}$, and abilities, $\theta_j$
    \item Different levels of beliefs, $(\alpha_{j0}, \beta_{j0})$
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3ex}
Simulations above show this leads to different specialization decisions
\begin{itemize}
    \item [$\implies$] This is connected to statistical discrimination
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3ex}
Large statistical discrimination literature to draw on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inaccurate statistical discrimination

Presented a model of how group-based beliefs can influence specialization
\begin{itemize}
    \item How realistic is this model?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3ex}
\textbf{Next goal:} re-create dynamics of major choice over time
\begin{itemize}
    \item Building a dynamic model of major choice
    \item Identifying model parameters
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3ex}
Plan to do this:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine the diffusion process first to build the dynamic model 
    \item Think about identification in terms of an experiment
    \begin{itemize}
         \item What experiment could I run to recover my parameters of interest?
         \item Should I change some model fundamentals?
