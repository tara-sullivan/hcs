\begin{frame}{What drives differences in gender convergence across fields?}

% What drives these differences in gender convergence across field?
% We can look to the literature on the determinants of college major choice for guidance

Why might we see these differences?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Differences in wages
    \item Differences in preferences or norms
    \item Social networks and role models
    \item Uncertainty about abilities
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2ex}
Problem: how do these things interact?
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can your network influence your beliefs about your abilities?
    \item How can shared uncertainty influence norms? 
\end{itemize}

% \textbf{This paper}: builds a model of \blue{human capital specialization} (i.e. major choice)
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Students don't know their true ability in different majors
%     \item Initial beliefs about their abilities are shaped by existing outcome for their group (i.e. gender)
% \end{itemize}
% \textbf{Question:} How does this impact major choice?

\pause
\vspace{2ex}
\textbf{My research:} the role of group-based beliefs in human capital specialization decisions

\vspace{2ex}
Model of gradual human capital specialization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unknown heterogeneous abilities 
    \item Group-based beliefs about abilities 
    \item Sequential learning and human capital accumulation
    \item [$\implies$] Group-based beliefs play an important role in specialization decisions
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Dissertation road map}

\textbf{Chapter 1:} Introduction to model
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporate group-base beliefs into Alon and Fershtman (2019)
    \item Simulate decisions given different beliefs
    \item Connection to statistical discrimination
\end{itemize}


\vspace{4ex}
\textbf{Chapter 2:} Re-create dynamics of major choice across gender
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporate intergenerational learning into model
    \item Identify model parameters
\end{itemize}

\vspace{4ex}
\textbf{Chapter 3:} Quantitative exercises
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implications of group-based beliefs for aggregate productivity
    \item Policy analysis: affirmative action
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Limited Literature Review}

1. Human capital specialization
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build on model of gradual specialization from Alon and Fershtman (2019)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{4ex}
2. Gender gaps in college choice
\begin{itemize}
    \item Empirically motivated by Sloan, Hurst, and Black (2020)  % pre-labor market human capital specialization
%     % Use newly expanded ACS data that asks about major choice for college educated individuals
%     % Women choose college majors associated with lower potential wages than men
%     % Need to understand this better!!
% Gender gap in schooling and experience has shrunk
\end{itemize}

\vspace{4ex}
3. Determinants of college major choice, in particular the role of beliefs
\begin{itemize}
    \item Arcidiacono et al. (2015): model of sequential learning and role of beliefs
    % does not easily allow for granual fields
    % no human capital accumulation
    \item Subjective expectations literature (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2014; Wiswall and Zafar, 2019; Zafar, 2013)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3ex}
4. Statistical discrimination literature 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lundberg and Startz (1984): efficiency of equal opportunity laws
    \item Coate and Loury (1997): permanent affirmative action and patronizing equilibria
\end{itemize}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Dynamics similar to
