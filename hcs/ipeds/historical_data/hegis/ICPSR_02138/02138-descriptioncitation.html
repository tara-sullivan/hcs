		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS)
series was designed to provide comprehensive information on various
aspects of postsecondary education in the United States and its
territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
and the Marshall Islands) and Department of Defense schools outside
the United States. Data are available for both public and private
two-year and four-year institutions. The HEGIS Earned Degrees
component for 1970-1971 offers data on the type and control of the
institution, and the total count, by field of study, of earned degrees
and other formal awards conferred by each institution surveyed. Key
data elements include sex of student, level of degree or award, and
field of specialty.</span></p>
