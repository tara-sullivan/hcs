# Overview of `model/` directory

Contains python code for finding optimal policy of agents in a simple version of my model; for simulating agent behavior; and for generating plots about agent characteristics and agent behavior.

* afmodel.py: Finds optimal agent behavior in a simple version of the model. Includes functions for determining agent's lifetime specialization choice, human capital outcomes, etc. 
* beta_distribution_example.py: Examples of beta distributions used in paper/slides
* model_plots.py: Creates all plots created in this module
* sim_agents.py: Simulates agent behavior 
* sim_plots.py: Creates plots of simulated agent's behavior
